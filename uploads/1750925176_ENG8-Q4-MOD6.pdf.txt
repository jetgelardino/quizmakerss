Hi! Are you done with the pre-assessment test? This time, please continue answering
the following exercises in your notebook.
Directions: Determine if the text is narrative, descriptive, expository, or persuasive.
Write the letter of the correct answer in your notebook.
A. Narrative text tells us either true or fiction events or connected sequence
of events. These events are recounted by the narrator to the readers.

a reader. This text can be an argument, exposition, discussion, review or it
can also be an advertisement.
1. Teacher Raxie works hardly for the Regional Surveillance on School-Based
Management. With much tasks to accomplish, her hair looks unfixed and untidy.
Her face seems to frown as if no energy is left of her. She barely stands just to
cope with all the needed things to accomplish. With tired-looking eyes, she keeps
them attended by displaying necessary documents on screen.
2. How many times do I have to tell you? We have to work hand-in-hand in order to
sustain our best practices. This recognition defines who we are in everything that
we do. Would it be easy for us to just let go of this status? Let us therefore make
sure that justice will be serve to our hardworking people!
3. Yesterday, our Principal Madam Dorothy L. Suazo appeared before the Barangay
Officials’ regular session to make necessary arrangements in preparation for the
conduct of Regional Surveillance on the Sustainability of School-Based
Management (Advanced Level) at BNHS. Our principal took pride in informing the
barangay that Buenavista NHS is the only school in the barangay who had been
declared as SBM (Advanced Level) implementer. The principal also communicated
5

among Grade 7 Learners. The session ended with a manifestation of 100% support
from the Barangay Officials on the conduct of the aforesaid event on April 23.
4. Buenavista National High School has gone to its 1st Surveillance after being

Caraga Region Facebook Page)
7. “The pandemic continues to weigh us down but we still have something going on
in our Region that will make us excited for our future. This pandemic provided us
the right time and ample opportunities for doing action researches. We must take
a closer look at these needs to find ways to satisfy our clients. If ever there is the
best time to conduct research, this is the time,” said Regional Director Dr. Evelyn
R. Fetalvero in her message. She also challenged everyone in the department to
“embrace research with passion.” (DepEd Caraga Region Facebook Page)
8. Libertad National High School Dance Company performed a special pre-recorded
dance presentation during the intermission. The dancers harmoniously moved

to a journey. The show can still be viewed on the DepEd Caraga Region and DepEd
Philippines Facebook pages. (DepEd Caraga Region Facebook Page)
9. Time is gold. True, you can buy Gold at shopping malls, jewelry stores, and
pawnshops. But can you buy time? NO. Time is even more valuable than the most
expensive gold. You cannot turn back time, even if you had zillions. If you lost
gold, you could always purchase a replacement. But if you lost time, could you

seek for another time? NO. That is why time is very precious. Every tick-tock is
worth the grandest gold karat man has ever bought. (Algien A. Parker)

little ways such as cleaning the house, helping your younger siblings in their
assignments, and among others. You are never too sure. So wake up, get up and
work. Remember that Grasshopper, who just played the whole summer, asked
help from little Ant who worked his back to store food for winter. (Algien A. Parker)

the wonderful people, all shape your experience in this refreshing beach. Children
play, mothers bond, and fathers rest.
12. Here comes another busy day. People sit on their tables. They open their laptops.
Some work with music while others listen to news simultaneously. Meetings here
and there, attending either virtually or face-to-face. People ask reports from each
other, walking fast and furious. They are as busy as the bees.
13. A hundred years ago there lived a king. He had some beautiful daughters, but
the youngest daughter was the most beautiful. Close by the king’s castle, there
was a great dark forest. And under an old lime tree in the forest, there was a well.
When the day was warm, the king’s youngest daughter usually went out into the
forest. When she was bored, she took her golden ball and played with it.

now?" "Reward?" scoffed the merchant greedily counting the amount of gold. "The
purse I dropped had 200 pieces of gold in it. Youve already stolen more than the
reward I’ll give to you.! Go away or I’ll tell you to the police." (The Purse of Gold)

CO_Q4_English 8_Module 6

2. What do you think are the qualities of a good speaker? Can you give at least
three?

What is It
Let us have a brief discussion of the lesson. The following points will help you
discover and understand new concepts and skills in the delivery of a self-composed
speech.
What is speech?
Speech is the use of language in human vocal communication. Each language
uses phonetic vowel and consonant sound combinations that form the sound of its
words. Speakers perform several different deliberate acts of speech, for example,
telling, announcing, questioning, persuading, directing. To express meaning, they
may use enunciation, intonation, loudness, tempo, and other non-representational
or paralinguistic aspects of vocalization.
You may refer to all social interactions in which language plays a significant
role as speech events. The interlocutors (the people talking to each other) usually
face each other in a discussion and do not speak at the same time. Most people
initiate their conversations and greet each other, then continue to talk in a turntaking way.
Some of the speech events you may be engaged with is when you deliver your
speech during the room-to-room campaign for an SSG election, turn-over speech
during the Juniors-Seniors Promenade, and welcome address or speech of gratitude
during a graduation ceremony. (Hutchinson et al., 2020)
9

CO_Q4_English 8_Module 6

What are the characteristics of a good speech?
A good speech has qualities which can convey a message effectively through
words of mouth or spoken words. Expression should be transparent and
unambiguous so that it is easy for the public to understand. It should be delivered
in an unbiased and unemotional way so that it doesn't drive the audience away from
the main theme. A good speech is one that ensures the participation of the audience
with the speaker and ensures the audience will ensure their attention through
effective listening, expressing their solidarity with the speech and so on. (Based on
“Delivering a Speech Lesson Plan” from study.com)
How to write an effective speech?
Research indicates that the speeches make people remember so little. People
can hear and not understand the voice. Write two simple phrases instead of one long,
complicated sentence. Interpret your speech aloud as you write it down. Your
question should be a representation of who you are and what you care about. Do
analysis. If you have the evidence to back him up, your new policy plan will sound
very good.
In writing your speech, always remember the following conventions to help
you make your speech an effective one:
•
Introduce yourself
• Make a great opening statement (a rhetorical question, a surprising
statement, a famous quote)
•
Structure your speech
•
Begin every paragraph with a topic sentence
•
Use very good English
•
Express your opinion
•
Write from the 1st person and engage your audience
•
Use personal details and anecdotes
•
Use rhetorical questions
•
Use emotive language
•
Use figurative language
•
Use contrast
•
Use repetition
•
Use the list of three
•
Focus on the topic
(Based on “How to Prepare and Deliver a Speech Effectively,” n.d.)

CO_Q4_English 8_Module 6

The Structure of Your Speech

(https://www.perthtoastmasters.org/experiences-speech-ideas-example-speech
-creative-process-conception-execution/)

Introduction
Because the introduction serves as both a sales pitch and a useful outline, it should
strike a good balance between hype and content. Get the audience's attention,
introduce the subject, clarify its importance to the audience, state a thesis or intent,
and outline the key points which are all essential. You can have a road map that
outlines your key points by the end of the introduction. (Based on “Boundless
Communications” from courses.lumenlearning.com)
Body
The body of a speech is the central section of the speech in which the main ideas and
key concepts of the speech are discussed. Except for the introduction and
conclusion, the body is everything. The main points of a speech make up the body of
the speech. This is significant because it aids the audience's comprehension of your
speech. (Jackson, n.d.)
Conclusion
Your speech's conclusion summarizes your main points and purpose while leaving a
lasting impression on your audience. The conclusion's purpose is to summarize your
main points and prepare the audience for the end of your speech. You'll want to
recapture the essence of your speech, including your main points and the reason
you spoke. It's especially important to remember that the end of your speech isn't
the time to introduce new points or new supporting evidence; doing so will only
confuse the audience. Consider your conclusion to be like tying a bow or a ribbon:
it's the finishing touch that makes your project stand out. (Based on “Boundless
Communications” from courses.lumenlearning.com)

A measure of perceived
intellect or education is
how well we articulate.

Pronunciation

Congratulations! You have made it this far. Aren’t you proud of yourself? You
have performed varied activities which added more to your knowledge. You are now
in the final round. Good luck!
1. Practice Inflection
Gather some children's books (aimed at 6-10 years of age) and read them
aloud in class or at home. Using inflection to show the punctuation, the force and
the characters. Don’t be scared! Remember this is how most kids learn to read and
speak.
2. Pronunciation
Put several forms and backgrounds into many books, or publications. Browse
through the email and find odd words. Look at them in a dictionary online or offline
and see how they are pronounced. It could turn into a ‘stump the speaker’ game of
guessing how every word is pronounced. This can also be used to point out certain
common words which are frequently mispronounced.
3. Projection
Think of an interesting topic. Talk to yourself in a mirror. Don't scream. Keep
it going for a few minutes (it's going to be loud), then ask someone in your home
about his/her observations of what you are doing.

Additional Activities
The true test for this lesson is in the actual presentation of the speech. Like voice
and diction, understanding what makes a speech effective without practice is
insufficient. It is useless to learn about the efficient delivery of a self-composed
speech unless you put it into practice for it reinforces the knowledge. Comprehending
the rules for driving on the road is dangerous if the rules are not obeyed in practice.
The same is true for this chapter.
Constant correct practice of speaking will make you a more effective speaker!

1. My Friend’s Fictional Life
What you do in this activity is you stand up before people (you can do it home
by yourself as well) and you take one of your friends and introduce them to them.
Instead of presenting them in the usual way, though, you are making them up a
fictional story.
So, you say, hi this is Samantha, and she moonlights as a guitarist in the
church. And you talk about her life, whatever it may be.
2. Impromptu Game
Essentially, you just get up in front of people and someone gives you
something impromptu in which to ride.
It could be a topic; it could be a sentence, or it could be just a single word or
something like that. But we run on just one subject.
For example: You need to talk about the Corona Virus Disease of 2019, or you
need to talk about what makes you a great learner, or you need to talk about social
distancing or constant proper handwashing. So that’s the impromptu game.
